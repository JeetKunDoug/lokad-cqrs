Snippet: Configurable PubSub Router
===================================

This router does 3 things:

1. Maintains routing (publish/subscribe) map
2. Routes event to subscribers using this map
3. It routes commands to a single queue (hardcoded)

This snippet could be expanded to support command partitioning (entity 
partitioning) or topic-based subscriptions in a similar manner.

Routing map is persisted in the atomic storage (using whatever storage system
is configured for it). Routing map can be managed remotely via the control
messages which come in the form of envelopes without the content but with
special attributes:

**To subscribe**:

    key: router-subscribe-QUEUE-NAME
    value: REGEX

**To unsubscribe**:

    key router-unsubscribe-QUEUE-NAME
    value: REGEX

Where REGEX matches against the full name of the message event type. In your
scenario match could be implemented differently.
