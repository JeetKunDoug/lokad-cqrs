Snippets
========

This is a collection of samples and code snippets, that explain and show how to
use Lokad.CQRS in real-world systems to handle specific problems. 

Some of these snippets are actually taken from the real world projects and then
reused by other community members.

So if you find a bug or issue in the code, please let us know. Pull request 
would even be more terrific (even if it just a few lines of comments to the 
code).

Snippets come accompanied with Readme files. BTW, it's more fun to explore them 
via web-browser on the web (go to github.com), since this markdown gets 
rendered nicely.
